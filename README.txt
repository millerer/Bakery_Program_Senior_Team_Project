Winter 2015 Oregon State Univeristy Graduation Project by Eric Miller, Jason MacManiman, and Renee McLain.

My (Eric Miller's) contribution was the development of a Python UI using the ncurses library to interface with 
a postgresQL database. My code is contained in the python file 'finalBakery'. Please note that the syntax I 
used to create a database connection was originally reaserched and sourced from my team mate Jason MacManiman.

To build and run the project, as well as see further details on the original project requirements, please read 
the attached PDF document 'FinalReport-Team6.pdf'.
